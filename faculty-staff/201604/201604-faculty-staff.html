                                        <p style="margin-top:0px;">This weekend, the first class to graduate under the college&rsquo;s new name will receive their diplomas and head out into the world. I&rsquo;m so grateful for the ways each of you has contributed to their excellent engineering education &ndash; I truly believe these graduates will transform the future.</p>
                                        <p style="margin-top:0px;">It&rsquo;s been a very exciting spring for the college. We had over 400 people attend our Engineering Leadership Summit, where we discussed the role of women in technology. We also launched the UF Innovation Station Sarasota County, the first engineering extension office of our Florida Engineering Experiment Station. We received $13.8 million this month from the legislature towards our new building &ndash; the Herbert Wertheim Laboratory for Engineering Excellence, which we will break ground on this fall.</p>
                                        <p style="margin-top:0px;">The college is growing and our impact in the world is expanding. Read all about it below!</p>
                                        <p style="margin-top:0px;">Best regards,</p>
                                        <p style="margin-top:0px;">Cammy</p>
